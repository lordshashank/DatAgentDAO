<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.ethglobal.com/showcase/datagent-dao-gkd66)

### The Problem

AI has been trending all over the world be it chatGPT, stable diffusion, etc. These models are trained on data being served to them through internet, etc. Currently its a bunch of people who decide what data to serve and various other decision, giving them total control over the protocol. This has led to the concerns stated by many people around the world over centralized control of something like AI having immense capabilities in them. Don’t worry DatAgent has come to your rescue.<br/>

### The Solution

DatAgent DAO is one-stop complete on-chain solution for decentralizing the this whole AI protocols and giving control to users to improve as well as have a say in decision making of them. It provide protocol governance with help of DAO on FVM which allows on-chain dataset transfers along with the general features of DAOs enabling voting on what data the AI is going to be trained and what not. Moreover, anyone can put their own dataset as proposal to make the model more efficient and earn the governance token in return, this would motivate many people to provide dataset which would eventually improve the model a lot as well. People could also ask the protocols for certain datasets and models as per their ask so as to use them for themselves as well. This way the decision making in the AI protocol is decentralized but let’s say we have an approved dataset, is there a way to train the model and get the results on-chain as well?<br/>
The answer is yes, thanks to Bacalhau and their project Lillypad. The models could be deployed on bacalhau and be interacted on-chain through smart contracts. Once the proposal of dataset is accepted one can initiate the training of model on that on-chain and even get results on that fine-tuned model on-chain with help of our DAO.<br/>
This results in complete decentralized on-chain solution for complete working of an AI company enabling users to have a say in the protocol and having complete transparency on decision being made.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Any AI protocol can opt DatAgent DAO to decentralize their protocol and make it more transparent and efficient. The protocol can be deployed on bacalhau and then the DAO can be deployed on FVM. The protocol can then be integrated with the DAO and the governance token can be distributed to the users. The users can then vote on the proposals of dataset and the approved dataset can be used to train the model on-chain and the results can be obtained on-chain as well. This would make the protocol more transparent and efficient as well as decentralized.
An example of this for Stable Diffusion is shown in the demo video here.
